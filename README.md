# Mchezopesa-Football-Outcome-Prediction

# Overview

Mchezopesa Limited wishes to build prediction model to help with football predictions. The main focus shall be:
**Research Question:** Can we predict the result of a game between Team 1 and Team 2, based on which Team is playing at home or away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

The input for this analysis will include data on Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

The two possible approached while addressing this question shall include:
1. **Polynomial Approach** - Here we shall predict the number of goals by the home team scores and number of goals by the away team
2. **Logistic Approach** - Where we shall figure of from the home team's pespective whether a game is a Win, Loss or a Draw (W, L, D)

NOTE:
A more detailed explanation and history of the rankings is available here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings

An explanation of the ranking procedure is available here: https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/procedure/men

# Assessment Expectation

In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following: 
1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
2. Expected flow for the assessment:
- Perform your EDA
- Perform any necessary feature engineering 
- Check of multicollinearity
- Start building the model
- Cross-validate the model
- Compute RMSE
- Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test           
3. Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification
4. Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
